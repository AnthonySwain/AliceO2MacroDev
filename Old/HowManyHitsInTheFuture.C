/*Creates and saves a histogram which for each voxel, returns a value for how many hits each step contibuted to in the future (e.g. if a particle)
leaves two hits in the future, each step in a voxel it takes, would add a value of 2 to the voxels until one of the hits is done, then it will add 1, then when both are done, it will add 0 to the voxel
as the steps calculated no longer contribute to hits*/
